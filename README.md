# Object-Detection-and-Track-a-Baseball
The study introduces a technique for identifying and monitoring the movement of baseball pitches using two video clips. Additionally, we exclude stationary objects from consideration as we focus on detecting a moving object. Upon establishing the area of interest (AOI), we effectively detect the ball's position and track its trajectory.
